<h2>The Christian Will Never See Death</h2>

<h3>March 17, 2024</h3>

<h4><em>By Joseph D. Klotz</em></h4>

<blockquote>"I am not possessed by a demon," said Jesus, "but I honor my
Father and you dishonor me. I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is
one who seeks it, and he is the judge. Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys
my word will never see death." (John 8:49-51).</blockquote>

<p>Jesus said that anyone who keeps His word would never see death. What
does He mean? The Pharisees call out Jesus on this, and it seems like they
have a point. Everyone dies. We are all subject to death. From Adam, through
whom death was introduced into creation; through Abraham, and the patriarchs;
through the prophets and kings, including king David. Everyone dies. They
witnessed it during Jesus' ministry. They could point to David's tomb. So what
was Jesus talking about?</p>

<blockquote>Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face
the judgment, so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sin of many; and
he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to
those who are waiting for him. (Hebrews 9:27-28).</blockquote>

<p>It is indeed appointed for man to die once, and then to face the judgment.
Men are subject to death because all men are sinners. Paul tells us plainly
that the wages of sin is death (Rom. 5:12). In other words, death is what we
have earned for our work of disobeyeing God. (Pieper, 1953) But don't forget
that there are three kinds of death. There is the first death, the physical
(or temporal) death. There is also a second death, the spiritual death.
Physical death is the unnatural tearing apart of body and soul. Spiritual
death results in the third kind, which is eternal death. (Pieper, 1953)
Eternal death is the separation of the person, who is composed of that
rational soul and human flesh combined, from God forever by being cast into
hell.</p>

<p>At the time of physical death, body and soul are separated. This is
something unnatural that was not intended to happen. The dust of the body
returns to the ground. The body is burried and experiences decay. The spirit
returns to God, who gave it (Ecclesiastes 12:7). The body "sleeps" while the
soul goes to heaven to be with the Lord. Paul, writing to the Philippians,
explains that his death is desirable to him, because it would mean that,
though Paul would be physically dead, he would be with the Lord in the
heavenly paradise. Paul wrote to the Philippians:

<blockquote>I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ,
which is better by far; but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the
body. (Philippians 1:23-24).</blockquote>
                                         
<p>Jesus also promises the thief on the cross next to Him, not that he will
be dormant in the grave, body and soul, until the judgment. He assures the
man, "Today you will be with me in paradise" (Luke 23:43).</p>

<p>Jesus tells us that those who are in Him do not need to worry about the
physical first death. This death could not hold Jesus. And, if we keep His
word as He says, it will not hold us either. This is what Jesus meant when He
said:</p>

<blockquote>Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the
soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in
hell. (Matthew 10:28).</blockquote>

<p>That one who can destroy both body and soul in hell is Jesus. And He
would demonstrate His power over death when He rose from the dead after His
death on the cross.</p>
                       
<p>But Jesus actually does demonstrate His power over death before His
resurrection. Jesus calls Himself the Resurrection and the Life. He has the
power to bring back to life those whose souls and bodies have been torn
apart by death. He did it for the widow's son; for Jairus' daughter; for
Lazarus. Reversing physical death is short work for Immanuel, God with us,
the One by whom all things were made. So we don't have to worry about
physical death. Jesus will undo it. From our perspective, He has undone it
by His cross and empty tomb. And if we don't have to worry about physical
death, even if we have to experience it, we also don't have to worry about
spiritual or eternal death.</p>

<p>Jesus saves us from the second death as well. In fact, that is the
entire reason Jesus came to earth; the reason He took on flesh in the
Virgin's womb; the reason He lived a sinless life, and went to the cross. He
bore the guilt of our sin on the cross, paying the debt. He rose to life
again for our justification.</p>

<p>Now there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. (Romans
8:1) That is because in our baptism, Christ connects us to His death and
resurrection. In baptism He gives us those things. We get the credit for His
death; we get the promise of being raised to life in a resurrection like
His.</p>

<blockquote>Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ
Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore baptized into death in
order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with him in a
death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection
like his. (Romans 6:3-5)</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, baptism does now save us by the resurrection of Jesus. (1 Peter
3:18-22)</p>

<p>Martin Luther explains in the Small Catechism that all people will be
raised and will stand before Christ on the Last Day. (Luther, 1986).
Christians will rise to eternal life. Christ will transform their bodies to
be like His glorious body, though God's word does not give a lot of
information about what that will be like. People who do not believe in Jesus
will be told to depart into the eternal fire. Believers will experience life
everlasting. Unbelievers will experience everlasting death.</p>

<p>For the Christian, death has been transformed into a portal through  which
they pass into life. According to Pieper, the fear of God's wrath is what
made death terrible. (Pieper, 1953) Since Christ has made atonement for sin,
that fear disappears. Without having to fear God's wrath and punishment, the
Christian can look at death as a slumber from which we will awaken at
Christ's return and enter into eternal life.</p>
                
<p>That is what Jesus means when He says that those who keep His word will
never taste death.</p>

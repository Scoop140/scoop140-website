<h1><a href="king_1.html">You are Right in Saying I Am a King</a></h1>

<h2>March 27, 2024</h2>

<h3><em>by Joseph D. Klotz<br>
The Hodgkins Lutheran</em></h3>

<blockquote>Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked
him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Is that your own idea," Jesus asked,
"or did others talk to you about me?" "Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied. "It was
your people and chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have
done?" Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants
would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from
another place." "You are a king, then!" said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You
are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and
for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the
side of truth listens to me" (John 18:33-37).</blockquote>

<p>Who would have thought that anti-semitic non-Christians would start using
the phrase "Christ is King" as a way to intimidate and slander Jewish
people?</p>

<p>Not me, that's for sure.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise when on one of my <a href="https://megaphone.link/BMDC5458670249">regular podcasts</a>, for an entire hour,
this was the topic of discussion.</p>

<p>The host explained how Candace Owens, recently separated from Ben Shapiro's
"The Daily Wire" used the phrase in a post on X back in November 2023. She was called out for
anti-semitism by other members of the Daily Wire. Some of them posted about
how the phrase is anti-semitic, and that Jesus' name should never be used to
slander the race from which Jesus came, God's chosen people, the Jews. <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/daily-wire-host-condemns-candace-owens-and-christ-the-king-anti-semitic-crowd-for-using-scripture-like-satan-does-in-the-bible/">I think Andrew Klavan's response is worth reading/hearing</a></p>

<p>For sure Jesus' name should never be used to demean others. To do so is to
violate the Second Commandment. But it also got me thinking. The leftist
media is going to have a field day showing hypocrites who call themselves
Christians who are taking Jesus' name in vain, using it for the vile purpose
of trying to disparage another human being because of their so-called race.
It won't be long before there are stories in the mainstream media asserting
that saying "Christ is King" is hate speech, and orthodox Christianity is a
right wing hate group.</p>

<p>First, let's get this out of the way right off the bat. Anti-semitism is
wrong. Like racism of all other varieties, anti-semitism is sin.
Christianity, in fact, doesn't recognize the concept of race as it is
understood in the American socio-political context.</p>

<p>As trite as it may sound, the saying is true: there is only one race - the
human race. All people, being descended from our common parents Adam and
Eve, are all part of the same human family. We are called to love the Lord
our God with all our heart, soul, strength, and mind, and to love our
neighbor as ourself. To hate him because he is of a different ethnicity than
we are is the opposite of that command, and therefore we must repent.
Moreover, as St. Paul says to the Galatians, all of us who are a part of the
body of Christ are united in a way that supercedes all earthly differences:</p>

<blockquote>You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who
were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is
neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one
in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and
heirs according to the promise (Galatians 3:26-29).</blockquote>

<p>In spite of this, some might be tempted to say that Christians should stop
using the phrase "Christ is King" because it has been tainted with bigotry.
<a href="https://youtu.be/OhCPDcRuWcw?si=ommQ8S39EAybZTYn">The racist white supremacist Nick Fuentes has been using "Christ is King" in
some of his speeches</a>.</p>

<p>The impulse to not sound like these distasteful individuals, or to be
associated with their evil movements is understandable. Indeed we should not
want to sound like them. We must be careful, however, that we don't
overcorrect and slip into doctrinal error because we don't want to be called
racists.</p>

<p>More importantly, we must not let evil men steal from us our doctrine.</p>

<p>This is just another way for Satan to get us to be ashamed of the Gospel
message. We must instead declare with St. Paul that we are not ashamed of
the Gospel of Christ, because it is the power of God for the salvation of
all who believe, first for the Jew, then for the Greek. Satan would like
nothing more than to silence Christians from proclaiming the Gospel truth
that Jesus, true God in human flesh, Savior of mankind, is King of the
universe.</p>

<p>Despite who says it, or who it makes angry, and what their reasons are,
Christ is, indeed, King. He has died for the sins of the world. He has risen
from the dead for the justification of those who believe. And He will come
again in glory, as King, to be our judge. We Christians are to proclaim this
message of the cross, and that there is forgiveness of sins, life, and
salvation for all who repent of their sin and believe in Christ.</p>

<p>No matter what, people are going to be offended by the Gospel. It is, as St.
Paul says, a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Gentiles. But to we
who are being saved it is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</p>

<p>However, maintaining this doctrinal truth in America is not easy. It is
difficult to walk the narrow road between the ditch of being labled an
anti-semite on the one side, and denying what Christ says about Himself
being the only way of salvation for all mankind on the other.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/McCormickProf/status/1771980825623453826">Ben Shapiro shared a post from Robert P. George on X</a> which gets something
very wrong regarding Christianity's teaching on Jews and Judaism, and
illustrates just what the problem is. The post says:</p>

<blockquote>"For Catholics and other Christians, Holy Week is a time of spiritual
preparation for Easter. It is also a time to recall the rootedness of our
faith in that of our 'elder brothers' -- the Jewish people, 'whose covenant
with God is unbroken and unbreakable.'"</blockquote>

<p>White supremacists saying "Christ is King" in order to encourage the
defamation of Jewish people is wrong. That wrong, however, doesn't make what
Ben Shapiro posted in response to this controversy true. We Christians must
be careful not to go too far in the other direction and act as though we are
part of the same religion, or worshipping the same God as the religious Jews.
We are not, and we do not. God's special relationship with the physical
nation of Israel ended with the coming of Jesus and their rejection of Him.</p>

<p>Jesus teaches plainly of the impending rejection of the nation of Israel by
God (Judisch, 1978):</p>

<blockquote>"Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you
and given to a people who will produce it's fruit" (Matthew 21:43).</blockquote>

<p>Jesus makes this point in His parable of the Great Banquet as well. The
Great King prepared his banquet, but the invited guests rejected the
invitation and refused to come. The servant reported this to the master, who
sent the servant out to the streets and alleys of the town to invite the
poor, the cripled, the blind, and the lame:</p>

<blockquote>"'Sir,' the servant said, 'what you ordered has been done, but there is still
room.' Then the master told his servant, 'Go out to the roads and country
lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full. I tell you,
not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet" (Luke
14:22-24).</blockquote>

<p>God, the Great King, sent the invitation to His great banquet to His chosen
guests through Moses and the prophets. John the Baptist came as the herald,
announcing that the time had come. The kingdom of God, the preaching of
Christ, was at hand. All the invited guests should come to the banquet
(Kretzmann, 1921). But Israel, as a whole, rejected the invitation. Jesus
turns from the Jews, though He longed to gather them as a hen gathers her
chicks, because they refused to be gathered. He invites the spiritually
blind, poor and lame, tax collectors, sinners, and Gentiles to fill His
house.</p>

<p>In Christ all those who repent and believe the good news, Jew and Gentile
alike, are united into one body, which is Christ's. Christ's Gospel is
indeed the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes, first
for the Jew, then for the Gentile. And, in Christ, we are Abraham's seed and
part of the Israel of God where there is no Jew or Gentile, slave or free,
male or female. We are heirs to God's promise of forgiveness, life, and
eternal salvation in Jesus.</p>

<p>The good news is that Christ came to die as the propitiation for the sin of
the whole world. That includes everybody, including Jewish people. He offers
that forgiveness for sin, life, and salvation to all people through His word
and by His sacraments. To say that the Jewish people have a special
relationship with God because of their ethnic heritage is a false teaching.
What is worse is that it makes people of Jewish heritage feel secure because
of their blood line when they are outside of the body of Christ. It gives
them hope where there is none, in their flesh. But Jesus says faith in Him
is man's only hope:</p>

<blockquote>"...Does this offend you? What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he
was before! The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I
have spoken to you are spirit and they are life. Yet there are some of you
who do not believe  (John 6:61-64).</blockquote>

<p>Definitively Jesus declares:</p>

<blockquote>"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except
through me," (John 14:6).</blockquote>

<h2><a href="JN08_51.html">The Christian Will Never See Death</a></h2>

<h3>March 17, 2024</h3>

<h4><em>By Joseph D. Klotz</em></h4>

<img src="cranach.jpg" width="263" height="315">

<blockquote>"I am not possessed by a demon," said Jesus, "but I honor my
Father and you dishonor me. I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is
one who seeks it, and he is the judge. Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys
my word will never see death." (John 8:49-51).</blockquote>

<p>Jesus said that anyone who keeps His word would never see death. What
does He mean? The Pharisees call out Jesus on this, and it seems like they
have a point. Everyone dies. We are all subject to death. From Adam, through
whom death was introduced into creation; through Abraham, and the patriarchs;
through the prophets and kings, including king David. Everyone dies. They
witnessed it during Jesus' ministry. They could point to David's tomb. So what
was Jesus talking about?</p>

<blockquote>Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face
the judgment, so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sin of many; and
he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to
those who are waiting for him. (Hebrews 9:27-28).</blockquote>

<p>It is indeed appointed for man to die once, and then to face the judgment.
Men are subject to death because all men are sinners. Paul tells us plainly
that the wages of sin is death (Rom. 5:12). In other words, death is what we
have earned for our work of disobeyeing God. (Pieper, 1953) But don't forget
that there are three kinds of death. There is the first death, the physical
(or temporal) death. There is also a second death, the spiritual death.
Physical death is the unnatural tearing apart of body and soul. Spiritual
death results in the third kind, which is eternal death. (Pieper, 1953)
Eternal death is the separation of the person, who is composed of that
rational soul and human flesh combined, from God forever by being cast into
hell.</p>

<p>At the time of physical death, body and soul are separated. This is
something unnatural that was not intended to happen. The dust of the body
returns to the ground. The body is burried and experiences decay. The spirit
returns to God, who gave it (Ecclesiastes 12:7). The body "sleeps" while the
soul goes to heaven to be with the Lord. Paul, writing to the Philippians,
explains that his death is desirable to him, because it would mean that,
though Paul would be physically dead, he would be with the Lord in the
heavenly paradise. Paul wrote to the Philippians:

<blockquote>I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ,
which is better by far; but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the
body. (Philippians 1:23-24).</blockquote>
                                         
<p>Jesus also promises the thief on the cross next to Him, not that he will
be dormant in the grave, body and soul, until the judgment. He assures the
man, "Today you will be with me in paradise" (Luke 23:43).</p>

<p>Jesus tells us that those who are in Him do not need to worry about the
physical first death. This death could not hold Jesus. And, if we keep His
word as He says, it will not hold us either. This is what Jesus meant when He
said:</p>

<blockquote>Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the
soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in
hell. (Matthew 10:28).</blockquote>

<p>That one who can destroy both body and soul in hell is Jesus. And He
would demonstrate His power over death when He rose from the dead after His
death on the cross.</p>
                       
<p>But Jesus actually does demonstrate His power over death before His
resurrection. Jesus calls Himself the Resurrection and the Life. He has the
power to bring back to life those whose souls and bodies have been torn
apart by death. He did it for the widow's son; for Jairus' daughter; for
Lazarus. Reversing physical death is short work for Immanuel, God with us,
the One by whom all things were made. So we don't have to worry about
physical death. Jesus will undo it. From our perspective, He has undone it
by His cross and empty tomb. And if we don't have to worry about physical
death, even if we have to experience it, we also don't have to worry about
spiritual or eternal death.</p>

<p>Jesus saves us from the second death as well. In fact, that is the
entire reason Jesus came to earth; the reason He took on flesh in the
Virgin's womb; the reason He lived a sinless life, and went to the cross. He
bore the guilt of our sin on the cross, paying the debt. He rose to life
again for our justification.</p>

<p>Now there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. (Romans
8:1) That is because in our baptism, Christ connects us to His death and
resurrection. In baptism He gives us those things. We get the credit for His
death; we get the promise of being raised to life in a resurrection like
His.</p>

<blockquote>Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ
Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore baptized into death in
order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with him in a
death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection
like his. (Romans 6:3-5)</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, baptism does now save us by the resurrection of Jesus. (1 Peter
3:18-22)</p>

<p>Martin Luther explains in the Small Catechism that all people will be
raised and will stand before Christ on the Last Day. (Luther, 1986).
Christians will rise to eternal life. Christ will transform their bodies to
be like His glorious body, though God's word does not give a lot of
information about what that will be like. People who do not believe in Jesus
will be told to depart into the eternal fire. Believers will experience life
everlasting. Unbelievers will experience everlasting death.</p>

<p>For the Christian, death has been transformed into a portal through  which
they pass into life. According to Pieper, the fear of God's wrath is what
made death terrible. (Pieper, 1953) Since Christ has made atonement for sin,
that fear disappears. Without having to fear God's wrath and punishment, the
Christian can look at death as a slumber from which we will awaken at
Christ's return and enter into eternal life.</p>
                
<p>That is what Jesus means when He says that those who keep His word will
never taste death.</p>

<h2><a href="walther2.html">Thoughts on CFW Walther's Lectures on Communism,<br> and How They Might Apply to Us Today</a></h2>

<h3>March 3, 2024</h3>

<h4><em>By Joseph D. Klotz</em></h4>

<p>Most Missouri Synod Lutherans don't know it, but CFW Walther, first president
of the LCMS, lectured against communism in St. Louis. He gave a series of
four lectures to his congregation in response to a German-language newspaper
in St. Louis that was advocating communism, called "Volksstimme des Westens"
(Voice of the People of the West). The lectures were edited and published in
English in 1879. The English translation was revised in 1947 by the Lutheran
Research Society.</p>

<p>These lectures are certainly relevant for us today. We don't talk about the
ideas Walther addressed in the same way he did in the 19th Century, and so
some of his warnings sound strange and outdated to us. However, we are still
contending with the same dangers, most notably the indoctrination of the
masses into atheist and collectivist ideas through the work of private,
semi-public, and public institutions.</p>

<p>Walther begins with and focuses on labor unions as a front for indoctrinating
the masses with communistic ideas. Walter makes it clear that he is not
advocating a new monasticism. Christians are to engage with the world. They
are to be, as the Bible says, in the world, but not of the world. Walther
identifies labor unions as not just a means for advocating for worker's
rights but mechanisms for spreading atheistic communism. This is the case for
the labor movement in general, but also in the particular case of the labor
supporting paper "Volksstimme des Westens" in St. Louis. Walther is
unequivocal: Christians cannot in good conscience be a part of such movements
or groups.</p>

<p>Walther demonstrates from examples in "Volksstimme des Westens" that the
editor of that newspaper advocates for atheistic communism, and that this
ideology characterizes the labor movement. Walther shows from examples taken
from "Volksstimme des Westens" that the editor supports the abolition of
religion, the abolition of private property ownership, the suppression of
marriage, and a broad-based, wide-scale worker's revolt. Walther says that
all of the international labor movement can be shown to have these tenets as
their foundational principles. The labor movement and communism are
inextricably wed.</p>

<p>The anti-family, anti-western, and anti-Christian ideas of the modern
American Left are direct descendants of the 19th Century Communism that
Walther was addressing.</p>

<p>Antifa looks a lot like what Walther warns against. They are violent
revolutionary urban communists who are being encouraged by the agitators to
rise up. They are the ones who have been indoctrinated with cultural Marxism,
what some call "woke," or "woke-ism," (usually without a precise definition).
Whatever you call what those who identify with Antifa have learned, they are
heeding the Marxist call to stop kissing the hand that hits them, and to
smash the greedy capitalistic monster into "atoms".</p>

<p>The basis of cultural Marxism are the ideas developed by Karl Marx and
Friedrich Engles in the 19th century. Marx said that in terms of economics,
society was divided into two classes: the bourgeoisie (those who controlled
the means of production), and the proletariat (the workers who were exploited
by the bourgeoisie to make a profit). Marx believed this was the basic
struggle of society, and can be used to explain other sociological and
anthropological issues. (Cooper, 2018)</p>

<p>Later thinkers applied Marx's ideas to other aspects of society besides
economics. Thinkers in Frankfurt, Germany known as "the Frankfurt School"
used Marxism to come up with what they hoped would be a theory of all
reality. This new theory was based on the concept of oppressor/oppressed
classes. It divided individuals into groups by race, class, or gender, and
was critical of historical western civilization. Critical Theory was born.
(Cooper, 2018)</p>

<p>Cultural Marxists look at all aspects of life through the lens of the
oppressor/oppressed class dynamic. This philosophy found widespread
acceptance among post-modern thinkers. Marx's philosophy called for a violent
revolution to overthrow the oppressor class and usher in the Dictatorship of
the Proletariat. Depending on the thinker, Cultural Marxism may or may not
contain the element of violent revolution. (Cooper, 2018)</p>

<p>To be "woke" means to have been awaked to these ideas of cultural Marxism,
particularly to the radical inequity said to be inherent in the
socio-economic and political systems of America; to understand that those
systems are utterly corrupt. This is particularly true for the criminal
justice system, education, and health care. The woke man works for the
destruction of the racist systems; the replacement of those corrupt systems
with new ones built on the principles of social justice, and the redress of
previous injustice through Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.</p>

<p>Walther says that even the organizations which do not actively promote those
ideas help the cause of those that do. A man cannot believe in the omnipotent
creator God, the inerrant word of God, or the Fall and Redemption of mankind
through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and at the same time be a
part of an organization that denies and opposes those things. Communism says
religion is a fantasy; that it is designed by the oppressor class to keep the
masses under control.</p>

<p>Marx and the Frankfurt School were critical of religion in general, and
Christianity in particular. This is partially because the Christian
worldview, with it's concept of original sin, denies that man is inherently
good. This means that the world is not naturally progressing upwards toward
communist utopia for, as Jesus says, "The poor you will have with you
always." (Cooper, 2018)</p>

<p>Moreover, in the cultural Marxist system people are not looked at as
individuals, but as groups. This leads to the concepts of collective guilt
and collective salvation. No matter how "good" a member of the oppressor
class is, they are still guilty of the evils of society because they belong
to the oppressor class. This is directly opposed to Christianity, which
teaches that men are redeemed from sin and death by the death and
resurrection of Christ; they are called as individuals to repent, and believe
the Gospel. (Cooper, 2018)</p>

<p>Walther makes a difference between communism and socialism. He says that
communism is more radical than socialism. He summarizes communism as a system
in which all goods are divided equally. He summarizes socialism as a society
in which there is no private property ownership, and all property is owned by
the government through what he calls "united labor." He sees socialism as
less egregious than communism. The problem is, as Walther sees it, the more
radical movement always wins out. Walther points to the French Revolution to
illustrate his point. It wasn't long before those who had fomented the
rebellion were sent to the guillotine by those more radical than themselves.
We can see this at work also in the Russian Revolution. If this principle is
true, it has grave implications for the United States and the socio-political
revolution we are entering.</p>

<p>The movement for social justice is not the civil rights movement of the 1950s
and 1960s. It is not the civil rights movement of Martin Luther King Jr. It
is a movement of cultural Marxism. Social justice does the opposite of what
Martin Luther King Jr. called for, namely that we should judge people based
on the content of their character rather than on the color of their skin, and
all people should have equal treatment under the law.</p>

<p>Ibram X. Kendi, one of the thought leaders of the social justice movement,
says, however, that we must fight discrimination with more discrimination.
What he means is, we must fight the institutional discrimination built into
our societal systems against people of color by the white oppressor class
with the discrimination against the white oppressor class. This is the
implementation of equity.</p>

<p>Equity means more than just creating a level playing field for all people. It
means equality of outcome. The woke Left argues that, for people of color to
prosper in our racist system, the beneficiaries of privilege must be
handicapped. (Miliken Institute School of Public Health, 2020)</p>

<p>Related to this idea of equity, the woke Left argues that racism is a white
phenomenon. Thinkers like George Yancy say that racism is inextricably
linked to the white systems of power. Yancy argues that white people have
been in power for 400 years, and that the systems of society were created by
them specifically to oppress black people. (Yancy, 2021)</p>

<p>Walther noted that the radicals ruled in France until God ended their rule.
(Walther, 1879) God is sovereign. He is ultimately in charge of all the kings
of the earth. We do well to remember that in America today. We desperately
need to bring our concerns, requests, and laments to Him in prayer as he
directs us in His word.</p>

<p>Because of man's fallen, selfish nature, communism can never progress beyond
this phase, generally known as the Dictatorship of the Proletariate. This has
been demonstrated time and time again throughout the world where communism
has been tried. Man is naturally selfish. He will not submit to the
communistic worldview willingly. Ironically, he will need to be forced into
the equality of communism, which goes against the claimed ideals of
Communism. The only man who willingly submits to the principles of communism,
Walther writes, are those who think they would be better off. (Walther, 1879)</p>

<p>Walther's point seems obvious. This is the reason that communism is always
imposed at the point of a gun. It is, perhaps, why the radical Leftists had
to abandon class warfare rhetoric in America, and transition to the cultural
Marxist rhetoric of social justice to advance their cause. Most people in
America believed they could improve their economic situation. In the case of
European immigration, that is why they came here in the first place.
Moreover, in America there was no established class structure as there was in
many European countries, particularly Germany and Great Britain. In America,
however, there was the problem of racism and racial inequality which could be
exploited to the advantage of the radical Left.</p>

<p>Walther says that only Christians are truly capable of putting others ahead
of themselves. He says that the unregenerate man is not motivated to work
except by profit. The Christian isn't working for money at all, but
understands that God will provide him with his daily bread. The Christian
serves in his vocation because God has given it to him to do, and by it he
loves and serves his neighbor.</p>

<p>Walther acknowledges the difference between real and false Christians. He
understands that what he says about selflessness applies to true Christians,
not those who merely profess Christ with their lips, who are part of a
so-called 'cultural' Christianity.</p>

<p>Happiness is a condition of the heart, not the bank account. It is part of
our fallen condition to think that acquiring money and possessions will bring
happiness. People do not want to accept this, even though they experience it
in their lives every day. (Walther, 1879) This covetous nature of fallen man
is what communists exploit to their advantage.</p>

<p>When Walther asserts that the Christian is always happy he isn't being trite
or naive. What he is talking about is this: The Christian understands that he
has the forgiveness of sins, eternal life, and salvation by the grace of God,
through faith in Christ. Walther distinguishes between the bigger concept of
happiness, and mood - something many in the LCMS today talk about in terms of
"Joy." Moods change and should not be mistaken for a person's broader
disposition. Christians are often sad. Walther says that the deeper one's
Christianity, however, the more he will be troubled with feelings of sadness.
Walther says such feelings are triggered by the Christian's awareness of his
sinfulness and sinful actions.</p>

<p>Walther conjectures that even professed atheists don't believe their own
arguments. Secretly, they know there is a God, and that they will be judged
by Him. God has written His law upon the heart of man. Man's conscience is
silenced inside him only by his stubborn refusal to believe, aided by the
working of Satan, which Walther calls hardness of heart.</p>

<p>As long as Christ tarries, this will be most certainly true. We Christians
are called to proclaim the message of the cross to a hostile world, for that
message is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes. And,
eventually, with the sounding of the last trumpet and the return of Christ,
communism, Marxism, woke-ism - all the "isms" - will pass away.</p>

<p>And the Word of the Lord will endure forever. ###</p>
